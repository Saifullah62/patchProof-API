# PatchProof‚Ñ¢ Authentication API ‚Äì Production Deployment Guide

## Overview
This API provides secure authentication, chain of custody, and on-chain anchoring for PatchProof‚Ñ¢ records. It is designed for production with robust error handling, modular funding, JWT-based authentication, and flexible database and secrets management.

---

## üöÄ Deployment Requirements

### 1. Environment Variables

For production, you must set the following environment variables. Do not hardcode these values.

#### Database
- `MONGODB_URI` ‚Äì Required. The full connection string for your MongoDB Atlas cluster.
- `DB_NAME` ‚Äì The name of the database to use within your cluster (e.g., `appdb`).

#### Secrets Management
- `MASTER_SECRET` ‚Äì Required. A strong, unique secret for deterministic key derivation.
- `API_KEY` ‚Äì Required. The API key for accessing protected endpoints.
- `JWT_SECRET` ‚Äì Required. The secret used for signing JSON Web Tokens.

#### On-Chain Anchoring (Funding Modes)
Choose one of the two modes below for on-chain anchoring.

**A. Dynamic SmartLedger Wallet Mode (Recommended for Production):**
- `SMARTLEDGER_API_BASE_URL` ‚Äì e.g. `https://smartledger.dev`
- `SMARTLEDGER_API_KEY` ‚Äì Your SmartLedger API key.
- `FUNDING_ADDRESS` ‚Äì BSV address to fund anchoring transactions.
- `FUNDING_WIF` ‚Äì Corresponding private key (WIF) for signing.

**B. Static/Manual Mode (Single UTXO, for dev/test):**
- `MERCHANT_API_URL` ‚Äì Merchant API endpoint for BSV broadcast.
- `UTXO_TXID`, `UTXO_OUTPUT_INDEX`, `UTXO_SATOSHIS`, `UTXO_SCRIPT_HEX`, `UTXO_PRIVKEY_WIF`, `UTXO_CHANGE_ADDRESS`

#### Other
- `PORT` ‚Äì Port to run the API (default: 3000).
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to `production` for live environments.

---

## Security & Operational Best Practices
- **Secrets:** Use a cloud secrets manager or HSM in production. Never hardcode secrets in source code or config files.
- **Key Rotation:** With dynamic funding, rotate `FUNDING_WIF` and funding addresses regularly. Multiple sources or wallet APIs can be integrated in the future.
- **JWT Expiry:** JWTs are short-lived (default 10 minutes). Adjust expiry as needed.
- **CORS:** Restrict allowed origins to trusted domains only (see below).
- **Rate Limiting:** Adjust thresholds based on expected traffic and threat model.
- **Monitoring:** Configure Winston or your preferred logger to forward logs to a central aggregation service. Optionally, add Prometheus metrics or APM.

---

## CORS & Rate Limiting Configuration

### CORS
By default, CORS is permissive for dev. For production, restrict origins:
```js
const allowedOrigins = [
  'https://proofpatch.com',
  'https://www.proofpatch.com'
];
app.use(cors({
  origin: (origin, cb) => {
    if (!origin || allowedOrigins.includes(origin)) return cb(null, true);
    cb(new Error('Not allowed by CORS'));
  },
  credentials: true
}));
```

### Rate Limiting
Default is 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP. Adjust for your needs:
```js
app.use(rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
  max: 100, // Tune for your traffic
  standardHeaders: true,
  legacyHeaders: false,
}));
```

---

## üöÄ CI/CD & Automated Testing

This project includes a ready-to-use GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration and deployment:

- **Lint & Test:** Runs `npm install` and `npm test` (Jest + Supertest integration tests) on every push and pull request.
- **MongoDB Readiness:** Ensures Mongoose connects before starting the app/tests; tests will auto-use mongodb-memory-server when MONGODB_URI is not set.
- **Example Workflow:** See `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for configuration (auto-created if missing).

**To enable:**
1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. GitHub Actions will run by default (see Actions tab).
3. Add secrets (if needed) for production deploys.

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema (MongoDB + Mongoose)

- This project uses MongoDB with Mongoose models. No SQL/Knex migrations are required.
- Models:
  - `models/AuthenticationRecord.js` ‚Äî immutable on-chain record data and indexing metadata.
  - `models/PatchState.js` ‚Äî current ownership/transfer state.
  - `models/VerificationCode.js` ‚Äî short‚Äëlived codes with TTL index.
- Connection lifecycle is managed in `config/db.js` (initDb/closeDb). The server starts only after Mongoose connects.
- Tests use `mongodb-memory-server` automatically when `MONGODB_URI` is not provided.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set required secrets:
  - `MASTER_SECRET`, `API_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`, `PORT`, etc.
  - For on-chain anchoring: `MERCHANT_API_URL`, UTXO vars, or SmartLedger wallet vars.
- See `.env.example` and README Environment section for all options.
- Start server:
  ```sh
  node app.js
  ```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Production Best Practices
- **Secrets:** Use a secrets manager or HSM in production. Never commit secrets to source control.
- **CORS:** Only allow trusted origins in production (see CORS config).
- **Rate Limiting:** Enabled by default, tune for your traffic.
- **JWT:** All sensitive endpoints require JWT authentication.
- **Chain of Custody:** Fully auditable, two-step transfer with cryptographic signatures.
- **Monitoring:** Winston logger supports log aggregation (Datadog, CloudWatch, etc).
- **Testing:** Run `npm test` for full integration coverage.

---

## üìñ API Documentation
- OpenAPI/Swagger docs available at [`/docs`](http://localhost:3000/docs) when running the server.
- See `openapi.yaml` for full endpoint specs.

### Verification Endpoint with Merkle Proof

`GET /verify/:txid`

Returns:
```json
{
  "txid": "...",
  "validHash": true,
  "validSig": true,
  "merkleProofValid": true
}
```
- `merkleProofValid` is `true` if the record's hash, Merkle path, and Merkle root together prove inclusion in the batch anchor.
- If the record was not batch anchored, `merkleProofValid` will be `null`.

---

## üîê Advanced Cryptographic Utilities

PatchProof‚Ñ¢ uses a modern, production-grade cryptographic toolkit in [`keyUtils.js`](./keyUtils.js) to ensure all authentication and chain-of-custody operations are secure, auditable, and standards-compliant (WP0042 / EP3268914B1).

### Key Features
- **Hierarchical Deterministic Key Derivation:**
  - `deriveKeyFromMessage(message, depth)` ‚Äì Deterministically derives a BSV key pair from any message (e.g., user ID, record ID). Supports optional hierarchy (depth).
  - `deriveEphemeralSessionKey(userId, label)` ‚Äì Generates a single-use/session key with timestamp entropy for login, claim, or transfer flows.
  - `deriveKeyTree(baseMessage, paths)` ‚Äì Derives a tree of subkeys for multi-branch workflows.
- **Digital Signatures:**
  - `signHash(hash, keyPair)` ‚Äì Signs a SHA256 hash with a BSV key pair (returns base64 signature).
  - `verifyHashSignature(hash, signature, pubKeyStr)` ‚Äì Verifies a signature against a hash and public key.
- **Canonical Object Hashing:**
  - `computeSha256(obj)` ‚Äì Computes a SHA256 hash of an object using canonical JSON serialization (field order independent).
- **Merkle Batching:**
  - `computeMerkleRoot(hashes)` ‚Äì Computes a Merkle root from an array of SHA256 hashes (for batch anchoring or multi-record proofs).
- **Merkle Proof Validation:**
  - `verifyMerkleProof(leaf, path, root)` ‚Äì Verifies a Merkle inclusion proof for a record in a batch anchor (used in verification endpoints).

### Example Usage
```js
const {
  deriveKeyFromMessage,
  deriveEphemeralSessionKey,
  computeMerkleRoot,
  signHash,
  verifyHashSignature,
  computeSha256,
  deriveKeyTree
} = require('./keyUtils');

// Deterministic user key
type KeyPair = deriveKeyFromMessage('user@example.com');

// Ephemeral session key
const sessionKey = deriveEphemeralSessionKey('user@example.com', 'login');

// Sign and verify
const hash = computeSha256({ some: 'object' });
const sig = signHash(hash, sessionKey);
const valid = verifyHashSignature(hash, sig, sessionKey.pubKey.toString());

// Merkle batching
const hashes = [computeSha256({a:1}), computeSha256({b:2})];
const root = computeMerkleRoot(hashes);
```

### Security Notes
- **No private keys are ever stored**: All keys are derived on demand from a master secret (see `secrets.js`).
- **Session/ephemeral keys** are unique per login/claim/transfer and cannot be reused.
- **Canonical hashing** ensures object hashes are stable regardless of field order.
- **All cryptographic operations** use industry-standard primitives (SHA256, ECDSA, HMAC).
- **Ready for Merkle batching**: Enables scalable, auditable batch anchoring for high-throughput use cases.

See [`tests/keyUtils.test.js`](./tests/keyUtils.test.js) for full test coverage and usage patterns.

## üí∏ Funding Abstraction & Extensibility
- The broadcast logic is fully abstracted: rotate funding keys, support multiple sources, or plug in a wallet service/API with minimal code changes.
- SmartLedger wallet integration is recommended for production.

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

This is a high-level checklist for deploying the API to a production environment.

- [ ] Secrets Management: All secrets (e.g., `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `MASTER_SECRET`, `API_KEY`) must be in a secure secrets manager. The app should have read-only access.
- [ ] CORS Configuration: Set `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to a comma-separated list (e.g., `https://proofpatch.com,https://www.proofpatch.com`).
- [ ] Database Indexes: Verify indexes exist for `authenticationrecords`, `patchstates`, and `verificationcodes`. Mongoose will attempt to create these; confirm in production.
- [ ] Rate Limiting: Enable and configure a production-appropriate rate limiter, optionally with a shared store (e.g., Redis) for multi-instance deployments.
- [ ] Logging: Configure Winston transports to forward logs to your centralized provider (Datadog/CloudWatch/ELK).
- [ ] On-Chain Funding: For static mode, ensure the funding UTXO has a small, monitored balance. For SmartLedger mode, secure the wallet/API keys.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Notes

The API includes multiple security best practices:

- Secure Headers: `helmet` sets key HTTP headers to mitigate common web vulnerabilities.
- Input Validation: V1 endpoints validate request bodies/params with Joi.
- Authentication: Sensitive endpoints are protected by JWT.
- Rate Limiting: Default limiter is included; tune thresholds for your traffic.
- Deterministic Cryptography: Keys are derived on-demand from a master secret and never stored at rest.
